# python list comprehensions are used for creating new lists form othe iterables like tuples,
#strings, arrays, lists etc.
#A list comprehension consists of brackets containg the expression, which is execute for each element
#along with the for loop to iterate over each elements

#syntax = newlist =[expression(elements) for element in oddlist if condition]


#python program to demonstrate list
#comprehension in python

#below list contains square of all
#odd numbers from range 1 to 10
odd_square = [x**2 for x in range(1, 11) if x%2 == 1]
print(odd_square)


# for understanding, above generation is same as,
add-square = []

for x in range(1, 11):
    if x % 2 ==1:
        odd_square.append(x**2)
        
print(odd_square)
