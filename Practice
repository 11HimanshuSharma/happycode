#python operators

#1..Arthematic operators
print(5+2) #addition

print(5-2) #subtraction

print(5*2) #product

print(5/2) #division

print(5%2) #modulas..i.e. remainder

print(15//4) #gives only the integer part of the quotient

print(5**2) # act as power operator that is 5^2

#2..Assignment operators

a=5 #assiging the value 5 to varibale a
print(a)
a+=3 #it means same as a=a+3
print(a)
a-=2 #it means same as a=a-2
print(a)
a*=5 #it means same as a=a*5
print(a)
a/=6 #it means same as a=a/5
print(a)
a%=3 #it means same as a=a%3
print(a)
a**=3 #it means same as a=a**3
print(a)
a//=4 #it means same as a=a//4
print(a)

#3..Comparision operators

print(3==4) #equality check

print(3!=4) #not equality check

print(3>4) #greater then check

print(3<4) #less then check

print(5>=6) #greater then equality check

print(5<=6) #less then equality check\

#4..Logical operators
x=2
print(x<5 and x<8) #return true only if both the statements are true
print(x>3 and x>1)

print(x>2 or x>1) #return true if atleast one of the conditions are true
print(x>2 or x>3)

print(not(x>2 or x>3)) #it returns the reversed result(vice versa)

#5..identity operators
a=[10,20]
b=[10,20]
c=a
print(a is c) #returns true if both the variables are the same object pointing to a same memory location
print(b is a) ##it will return false because only object is same but the memory location is different here

print(a==b) #it will only check only for the object value
print(a is not b) #returns true if both variables are not the same object
print(a is not c) 
print(a!=b) #it returns false as a is equal to b

#6..membership operator

a=[1,2,3,4,50]
print(2 in a) #in->returns true if the sequence is present in the object
print(3 not in a) #not in-> returns true if the sequence is NOT present in the object
