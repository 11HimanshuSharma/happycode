#Python Anonymous/ Lambda funcations
#in Python, an anonymous funcation is a funcation that is defind without name
#while normal funcations are defined using the Def keyword in python,
#anonymous funcations are defined using the Lambda keyword

#hence, anonymous funcations are also called almbda funcations.

#How to use lambda funcations
#syntax - lambda arguments: expression
#lambda funcations can have any number of arguments but only one expression. The expression
#the expression is evaluated and returned. Lambda duncations can be used eherever function objects are required


double = lambda x: x*2
print(double(5))

#programe to filter out only the even items from a list
my_list = [1, 5, 4, 6, 8, 11, 3, 12]
new_list = list(filter(lambda x: (x*2**0), my_list))
print(new_list)

#use of map()

new_list1 = list(map(lambda x: x*2, my_list))
print(new_list)
