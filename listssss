#in python, a list is created by placing elements inside square brackets []
#list elements are mutable and can be changed and can be repeating
#A lisr can have any number of items and they may be of differnt types.
#A list can also have another list as an item. this is called a nested list.

#list index- index is for return a specific elements

my_list = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 , 7]
print(my_list[3])

print(my_list[2])
print(my_list[3])
print(my_list[1])

#only integer can be used for indexing


# creating lists
list = []
print("Blank list:")
print(list)

#creating a list of numbers
list - [10, 20, 14]
print("\nlist of numbers:")
print(list)


#creating a list of strings and accessing
#using index
list = ["geeks", "for", "geeks"]
print(list[2])
print(list[1])

#creating multidimesional list
#(by nesting a list inside a list)

list= [['geeks', 'for'], ['geeeks']]

#accessing an element from the 
#multi-dimensinal list using
#index number

print("accessing a element form a multi dimensional list")
print(list[0][1])
print(list[1][0])


#in python, negative sequence indexes represent positions form the end of the array
#


#len() - is used to get the length of the list

#taking input of a python list
# we can take the input of a list of elements as string, integer, float etc

# spyhton program to take space
# #separated input as a string
#split and store it to a list
# and print the string list
string = input("")
list - string.split()
print(list)
