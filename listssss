#in python, a list is created by placing elements inside square brackets []
#list elements are mutable and can be changed and can be repeating
#A lisr can have any number of items and they may be of differnt types.
#A list can also have another list as an item. this is called a nested list.

#list index- index is for return a specific elements

my_list = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 , 7]
print(my_list[3])

print(my_list[2])
print(my_list[3])
print(my_list[1])

#only integer can be used for indexing


# creating lists
list = []
print("Blank list:")
print(list)

#creating a list of numbers
list - [10, 20, 14]
print("\nlist of numbers:")
print(list)


#creating a list of strings and accessing
#using index
list = ["geeks", "for", "geeks"]
print(list[2])
print(list[1])

#creating multidimesional list
#(by nesting a list inside a list)

list= [['geeks', 'for'], ['geeeks']]

#accessing an element from the 
#multi-dimensinal list using
#index number

print("accessing a element form a multi dimensional list")
print(list[0][1])
print(list[1][0])


#in python, negative sequence indexes represent positions form the end of the array
#


#len() - is used to get the length of the list

#taking input of a python list
# we can take the input of a list of elements as string, integer, float etc

# spyhton program to take space
# #separated input as a string
#split and store it to a list
# and print the string list
string = input("")
list - string.split()
print(list)


# adding somthing in the list
#append 
#using iterator
for i in range(1, 4):
    list.append(i)
print("\nlist after addition of elements from 1-3:")

#adding tuples to the list
#list.appned((5, 6))

# insert method only workd for the addition of elements at the 
#end of the list, for the addition of elements at the desired position,
#list.insert(i, element)

# extend method this method is used to add multiole elements at the same time at the end of the list


# reversing list
# using reverse method
#list.reverse()


#removing elements-
# list.remove()
#remove method in list will only remove the firse occurrence of the searched elements

# pop method is used for a specific output at the perticular index


# slicing of a list
#print elements from beginning to the end[:end]
# print whole list in reverse order [::-1]
